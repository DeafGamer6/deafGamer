abstract: This work provides discussion on the point of eSports and the lack of d/Deaf athletes within them. Is the inclusion of visual based audio accessibility `cheating' or inclusion? This work uses the game `Fortnite' as a case study into whether the inclusion of audio direction visualisations create an unbalanced game environment.

Spatial audio has become a mainstay and integral mechanic in many of the most popular eSports titles [3, 10]. 
eSports games, especially First and Third person shooters like Counter Strike, Fortnite, and Valorant among others,
use audio as a gameplay mechanic often used for identifying the location of other players around the map based
on the noises they make.
    Counter Strike is the most prominent example. Players, by sound alone, can identify the direction and distance
of footsteps and use that information to identify where the enemy is. In addition, players can identify the surface the
footsteps are on, giving an even more detailed account of where the enemy is. This is an acknowledged gameplay
mechanic that the game is built upon, (For example; the game advises players to walk instead of run because it
muffles the sounds of their footsteps). More recently with the release of CS2, and the audio engine upgrades that
came with it, players can now also distinguish between even more minute sounds. Such as being able to identify
the weapon held through a reload sound effect, or if an enemy is aiming down the sights of a scoped weapon.
    This has led to the phenomena of people optimising their audio setups for the best gameplay advantage. Major
eSports teams provide advice on ‘the optimal audio setup’ [2], players discuss best headphones used by pro players,
and many practice their reaction to the smallest of auditory cues on specialised maps [1].

This is a mechanic that many d/Deaf players cannot interact with, and with this audio mechanic being so
ingrained into the core gameplay, therefore are unable to compete to the same level [5, 4], by definition they are
disadvantaged by the game itself. One popular form of audio accessibility to combat this issue is audio visualisers,
often in the form of an audio radar. This is usually shown as a circle in the centre of the screen, where a portion will
light up based on the surround sound audio from the game. These have been shown to improve the performance
of d/Deaf and Hard of Hearing players [9, 7]. The example shown in fig 1 is from Fortnite.
The main complaint from community members is that it ‘creates an unfair advantage’ or will place some
players at a disadvantage. These complaints harbour on the belief that these accessibility options will oversimplify
the gameplay mechanics, making the game easier or reducing the skill ceiling.
*The skill ceiling refers to the highest level of gameplay skill one can achieve. Skills that are harder to master raise the skill ceiling,
while skills that are easier, lower the potential skill ceiling.

Within the eSports scene, Fortnite allows the use of their audio visualisation radar. These are allowed within
competitive play and have become a generally accepted part of the core gameplay loop, just as spatial sound audio
is in Counter Strike. Though there are claims of it creating an unfair advantage to d/Deaf players, or provide
hearing players with a further advantage, there is little evidence to back up this claim. Research shows that the
addition of alternative modalities do not improve the overall performance of the players [6, 11, 8].
Fortnite creates a more equitable system by turning the accessibility feature into a mechanic in itself. This
‘accessibility’ feature doesn’t just give you the information outright, it presents it in a competitively equitable
format. The radar does not directly point you at the sound, it provides a general direction, meaning the player
must still identify the exact direction through skill and gameplay. Similarly, it does not identify the type of sound
past its generalisation (i.e. gun, vehicle, footsteps), whereas a player using audio may still be able to distinguish
sub-categories within (i.e. which type of gun). For those that already know and use audio to determine direction,
the audio visualiser does not provide more meaningful gameplay information past confirmation of what they heard
in a visual format (as described by Granados [6]).

The implementation of this mechanic does raise the overall skill floor for d/Deaf and hearing players alike,
making them more competitively viable. However, if the inclusion of audio-based mechanics, that benefit those
with higher levels of hearing or better audio hardware, are not considered an issue to competitive balance, then why
are audio visualisations? By integrating audio visualisations as a part of their balanced competitive environment,
Fortnite has demonstrated that accessibility and competitiveness are not mutually exclusive.
