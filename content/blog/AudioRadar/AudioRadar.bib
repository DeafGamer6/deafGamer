	abstract = {In Virtual Reality (VR), virtual environments, and gaming, audio greatly impacts the user, yet it is an area that has been under researched quite recently. While music and environmental sounds have been used to great effect throughout gaming history to craft a more immersive experience, spatial audio doesn't see as much focus. Not only does well made spatial audio allow a user to become more immersed in their virtual experience, it is an important channel for information about their environment. With the advent of VR, games are putting more work into spatial audio and audio design, and now the results are becoming available for both research and game development. This paper will look at not only why spatial audio can greatly improve virtual experiences, but also some of the new technologies that have become available in recent times which make the implementation of spatial audio far easier and of a higher quality than ever before. It will also look at some planned research to examine the advantages of spatial audio in sonified virtual environments using Unity 3D.},

	abstract = {Spatial audio is an important component of realistic simulations in virtual environments. However, there have been shortcomings in existing spatial audio rendering systems, due to the computational cost of rendering realistic sound propagation. In this article, we present a novel spatial audio rendering method using 3-D graphs to simulate sound propagation in real time. We then ask if such a distinction in accuracy makes a difference to task performance, and test this proposition in a 3-D game. We conclude that improvements in spatial audio rendering do increase task performance.},

	abstract = {Mainstream games usually lack support for accessibility to deaf and hard of hearing people. The popular FPS game Half-Life 2 is an exception, in that it provides well constructed closed captions to players. In this paper, we performed a semiotic inspection on Half-Life 2, seeking to identify which strategies were used to convey information through audio. We also evaluated how the loss of information in each of them may impact players' experience. Our findings reveal that six different strategies are used and how they may compromise player experience.},

	abstract = {Accessibility is an aspect of video game development that has not been worked on to a great extent yet. It can have a great impact on gameplay, for those with some type of disability, and another large number of players who use those features to enhance their gaming experience. This potential is something that industry is beginning to consider seriously, as attested by the Accessibility in Video Games award at The Game Awards ceremony. Some of these features, such as subtitles, have been implemented in video games for a long time, but in a simplistic way and without the support of other tools that allow accessibility issues to be addressed from several fronts. The goal of this project is the development of an Accessible Audio Toolkit that extend the Unity environment allowing creators to easily introduce conﬁgurable hearing accessibility techniques into their games, showing sound direction using a compass or a 3D radar, and displaying more conﬁgurable subtitles. The results have been experimentally veriﬁed, adding these features to a simple game where sound is very important, putting players to play it without sound, in order to conﬁrm the eﬀectiveness of our tool. The software has been published on the Unity Asset Store, allowing the developers community to integrate it into their own projects.},

	abstract = {This study interviewed game audio professionals to establish the implementation requirements for an experiment to ascertain the effect of different spatial audio localisation systems on the perception of threat in a first-person shooter. In addition, a listening study was carried out involving 35 members of the public, and using three scenes made in Unreal Engine 4 with custom designed sound, authored in Wwise. This established that spatial audio does, indeed, have a noticeable effect on players' perception of threat. Each spatial audio system, however, had different effects on the perception of threat, stealth, realism and position estimation, on all three different visual scenes. Meanwhile, the absence of spatial audio can confuse people and contribute towards inaccurate enemy localisation. With this in mind, a tailored approach to the game design requirements for each project is recommended. Rather than a single, spatialised design for the entire game, each scene should have its own design solution.},

	abstract = {While game accessibility has improved significantly the last few years, there are still barriers for equal participation and multiplayer issues have been less researched. Game balance is here about making the game fair in a player versus player competitive game. One difficult design task is to balance the game to be fair regardless of visual or hearing capabilities, with clearly different requirements. This paper explores a tentative design method for enabling inclusive competitive game-play without individual adaptations of game rules that could spoil the game. The method involved applying a unified design method to design an unbalanced game, then modifying visual feedback as a hypothetical balanced design, and testing the game with totally 52 people with and without visual or hearing disabilities in three workshops. Game balance was evaluated based on score differences and less structured qualitative data, and a redesign of the game was made. Conclusions are a tentative method for balancing a multiplayer, competitive game without changing game rules and how the method can be applied.},
