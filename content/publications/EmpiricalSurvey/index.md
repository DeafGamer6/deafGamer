abstract: Previous work has explored d/Deaf and Hard of Hearing Gamers' (DHG) experience, focusing on best practices for captioning, and information representation with visual cues to enhance the DHG experience. In this paper, we present the results of an online survey (N=100) using Qualtrics involving participants who self-identified as having hearing loss to explore their satisfaction of audio accessibility in games. Our results showcase players resorting to makeshift solutions, such as avoiding certain games and entire genres due to the lack of audio accessibility. Overall, our participants articulates a clear need for more options and customisability. Comparing these experiences against current guidelines, we identify significant gaps in guideline adoption.  Based on our findings, we propose design opportunities to further audio accessibility in these areas.

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
